# PLSA Implementation

I present a Python implementation of the probablistic topic model (no background model) Probabilistic latent semantic analysis using the E-M algorithm. The implementation uses the equations derived [here](http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/course/598f16/plsa-note.pdf). Equations 4, 6 and 7 especially relevant.
