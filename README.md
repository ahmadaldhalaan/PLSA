# PLSA Implementation

I present a Python implementation of the topic model (no background) Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis using the E-M algorithm. The implementation uses the equations derived [here](http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/course/598f16/plsa-note.pdf). Equations 4, 6 and 7 are especially relevant.
